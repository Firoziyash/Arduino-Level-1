## Getting Started

To get started, you’ll need:
- An Arduino board (such as an Arduino Uno)
- USB cable to connect the Arduino to your computer
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- Basic electronic components (LEDs, resistors, sensors, etc.)

Each project has been designed to be simple to build and run, requiring minimal additional components. Code files are provided for each project that can be directly uploaded to your Arduino board.
